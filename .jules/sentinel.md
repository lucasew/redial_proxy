## 2023-10-27 - Unmaintained Dependencies and Binary Commits
**Vulnerability:** The application was using a SOCKS5 library that was over 8 years old and unmaintained, creating an open proxy risk because it lacked modern authentication features. A separate process failure led to a compiled binary being committed to the repository.
**Learning:** This incident highlighted two critical process gaps. First, unmaintained dependencies are a ticking time bomb for security; they don't receive patches and often lack features necessary for a secure implementation. Second, committing build artifacts is a major security and repository health issue. It bloats the repository, makes code reviews difficult, and can even be used to hide malicious code.
**Prevention:** I must add a dependency audit step to my initial scan of any repository. I will use `go list -m -json all` or similar tools to check for outdated and unmaintained libraries. Furthermore, I will always verify the project's `.gitignore` is comprehensive *before* compiling any code, and I will double-check the staged files with `git status` before committing.
